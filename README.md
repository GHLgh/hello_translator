# Translating One Tag a Day
There is a list of wonderful resource on [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) for developers. However, the localization process doesn't keep up with the growing of the resource. Some of the pages in foreign language (Chinese in my case) are even in a half-Chinese-half-English stage.

And one of my programming "mentor" believe that it is easier to understand and transform knowledge in technical documentations into skills when one is reading those documentations in his/her native language. So it appeal to me that localization might be something worth doing for developers who are not proficient in English (although it is still important to know English well for developers). What's more, the translation process can force me to actually read and learn something in a systematic way instead of learning from fragments of knowledge.

So here I am, using this repository to mark down what I have contributed to localization. <del>And what is more, this can make my contribution graph look prettier.

# Personal Conventions
* Any hypertext will be translated into following format: **text in local language [original hypetext]**. Note: if there is localized version of the directed page, replace the text in local language to a hypertext to localized page.
* For terminology and name of institution, etc. if there is acceptant localized version or its translation is self-explanatory, then it will be translated. Otherwise, it will be either translated into following format: **text in local language [original text]** or kept as what its original text is.
