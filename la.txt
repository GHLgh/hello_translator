Row picture / column picture / matrix form

ex.
 2x -  1y + 0z =  0
 -x +  2y - 1z = -1
 0x -  3y + 4z =  4
transform into matrix form
   A    X  =  b
| 2 -1  0||x|   | 0|
|-1  2 -1||y| = |-1|
| 0 -3  4||z|   | 4|
A: matrix of coefficient
X: vector of unknowns
b: vector

Row picture: basically draw the equations on a coordinate system 
             in this case, which is simply solving n equations with n unknowns
             [However, it becomes less intuitive when more dimensions are added]
             
Column picture: look at the column of the picture
 | 2| +  |-1|    | 0|   | 0|
x|-1| + y| 2| + z|-1| = |-1|  This is asking us to find the linear combination to produce the results (linear combination of columns)
 | 0| +  |-3|    | 4|   | 4|
geometry: treat each column as a vector and draw it in the coordinate system

Question: Can I solve Ax = b for every b? (or do the linear combinations fill the whole 3-D space?)
Answer:   For this example, yes (counter case: 3 columns happen to lay on the same plane)

Matrix form: Ax = b (multiply a matrix by a vector)
|2 5||1|    |2|    |5|   |12|
|1 3||2| = 1|1| + 2|3| = | 7|    (linear combination of columns or dot product if you do it row by row)

Ax is a combination of columns of A
